# 📦 Package Resolved for Playdate

It's another day at the Swifty Package Factory, and you have a long list of orders to deliver, with no time to spare! Can you collect all of the packages to deliver in the time allotted? Watch out for palettes and wet floors, or you'll get really injured!

> **Package Resolved** is a short game written using the Playdate SDK in C, originating from the Godot-based game of the same title for the 132 Trijam.
