# üì¶ Package Resolved for Playdate

It's another day at the Swifty Package Factory, and you have a long list
of orders to deliver, with no time to spare! Can you collect all of the
packages to deliver in the time allotted? Watch out for palettes and wet

> **Package Resolved** is a short game written using the Playdate SDK in
> C, originating from the Godot-based game of the same title for the 132nd
> Trijam.
